# ``Maestro``

Build complex, conducted animations declaratively without manually managing state.

## Overview

The constructs that SwiftUI provides for animating views work incredibly well when the transitions applied
to a view's presentation state are relatively simple or isolated. Performing more complex animations—say,
timing many transitions or transitioning values which may conflict—can quickly cause the code backing those
animations to become cumbersome to maintain and difficult to understand. Maestro allows you to represent
your complex animations as a single timeline that you provide to a view which will automatically supply
the animated values you specify.
